# MessageBird Magento Plugin

The purpose of this extension is to allow Magento Shop owners to keep their users informed about their orders using the power of MessageBird's SMS platform.

This extension currently supports two events:

1. Send an SMS message when a new order is placed to either Customer, Seller or to both
2. Send an SMS to the customer when the status of the order has changed.

These events can be enabled/disabled and configured in the configuration section of the Magento Shop. General information such as Access Key to the API, Originator and Seller’s numbers can be configured in this section.
